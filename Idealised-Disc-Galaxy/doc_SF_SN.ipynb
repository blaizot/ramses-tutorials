    "    Another common version of SN feedback implemented in RAMSES is the kinetic feedback, triggered by setting a positive value for `f_w` and `eta_sn`. In this version, instead of injecting the SN energy as thermal energy in the surrounding cells, it is injected as kinetic energy. By setting `f_w`, the star formation model is also slightly modified in the sense that a fraction of the gas $f_w M_\\star$ is additionally removed from the cell forming a stellar particle. This gas will directly be injected in the ejecta s.t. ${M_\\text{ej} = (f_w+\\eta_{SN})M_\\star}$. If `metal=.true.`, the ejecta metallicity is also modified and given by ${Z_\\text{ej} = Z_\\star+\\eta_Z(1-Z_\\star)\\frac{\\eta_\\text{SN}}{f_w+\\eta_\\text{SN}}}$. This ejecta is reinjected in cells within `rbubble` pc (with a minimum of $2\\Delta x$) with a momentum of $$u_{\\text{Sedov}} = \\sqrt{f_{\\text{ek}} \\eta_{\\text{sn}} E_{\\text{SN}} \\frac{M_\\star}{M_{\\text{ej}}}}.$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this equation, ${E_\\text{SN} = 10^{51}\\rm\\ erg/10\\ M_\\odot}$ and `f_ek` is the fraction of energy injected in the form of kinetic energy. Alongside kinetic energy, the remaining of the energy is injected as thermal energy: $$p_{\\text{gas}} = (1 - f_{\\text{ek}}) \\eta_{\\text{sn}} E_{\\text{SN}} M_\\star.$$\n",

    "    There are numerous additional modifications that can be made to model stellar feedback such as sampling SN explosions in time or injecting different momenta depending on how resolved the explosion site is. While not all of them are included in the core of the RAMSES code, some are available in the form of patches, such as `mom2` ([Kretschmer & Teyssier (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1385K)).
