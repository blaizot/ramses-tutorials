RAMSES tutorials for the successful astrophysicist
===============================

Welcome to our tutorial repository for the RAMSES code. You will find
here tutorials in which you will run and analyze a variety of advanced
simulations. The tutorials will cover the installation of RAMSES and
necessary tools, setting up the simulation parameters, running the
simulations, and visualizing the outputs. 

.. note::
  Before anything, you should make sure you install or load the
  compilers and other python libraries you will need. Follow the 
  instructions in the **Setting up** section and in the tutorials.

We recommend that the new users start with the **RAMSES Fundamentals**
tutorial.
