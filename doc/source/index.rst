RAMSES tutorials for the sucessful astrophysicist
===============================

Welcome to our tutorial repository for the RAMSES code. You will find
here tutorials in which you will run and analyze a variety of advanced
simulations. The tutorials will cover the installation of ramses and
necessary tools, setting up the simulation parameters, running the
simulations, and visualizing the outputs. 

.. note::
  Before anything, you should make sure you install or load the
  compilers and other python libraries you will need. Follow the 
  instructions here and there ...

We recommend that the new users start with the `RAMSES Fundamentals`
tutorial.
