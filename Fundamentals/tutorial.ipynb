    "\n",
    "RAMSES [(Teyssier 2002)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...385..337T/abstract) is a popular code used to produce astrophysical simulations, using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical technique, together with state-of-the art star formation and feedback models. Each directory contains a set of files with a given common purpose. For example, amr/ contains all Fortran 90 routines dealing with the AMR grid management and MPI communications, while hydro/ contains all Fortran 90 routines dealing with hydrodynamics. RAMSES is written in Fortran 90, which can be used on massively parallel architectures thanks to the MPI library (MPI stands for Message Passing Interface). Therefore, before producing RAMSES simulations, we need to compile the RAMSES code, as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to **obtain and compile the code**, you can follow the first steps of the documentation at [this link](https://ramses-organisation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki/Start.html), summarised (and updated) below.\n",

Namelists can be read and written as text files, usually ending with `.nml`. They are used to assign values to RAMSES variables, to be used instead of the default values initialised in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namelist files are organised in namelist blocks, or sections (that may be provided in any order) that define parameters related to different parts of the code. Each block starts with `&BLOCK_NAME` and ends with the character `/`. Values are then declared in the corresponding block using standard Fortran namelist syntax, i.e. as `parameter_name = value` (where values for character variables must be enclosed in quotes, and logical values must be specified using `.true.` or `.false.`). The following 4 parameter blocks are mandatory and must always be present in the namelist file:\n",

    "6. `BOUNDARY_PARAMS`: sets up boundary conditions for the current simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `UNIT_PARAMS`: contains the parameters related to units that are set “by hand” for non cosmological runs\n",

    "8. `COOLING_PARAMS`: contains parameters related to cooling / basic chemistry\n",

    "In the setup given to you, the light speed has been reduced to one-thousandth of the actual light speed (with the namelist parameter `rt_c_fraction=0.001`). This is good for performance – the lower the light speed the larger the timestep and the faster the simulation – but as you can see in the output, it is not very good for accuracy, as the actual front is lagging well behind the analytic result shown with the yellow circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RAMSES-RT code paper (Rosdahl et al., 2013), we derive a framework for setting a minimum value for the reduced light speed, while still retaining accuracy. The light speed fraction should be set to $min\\left(1;∼ 10 \\times t_{\\rm cross}/\\tau_{\\rm sim}\\right)$ where $\\tau_{\\rm sim}$ is some simulation timescale within which we want to get an accurate I-front position. Use this expression to set a new (higher) value for the reduced light speed. Then verify that the I-front is accurately simulated within the timescale you choose (by comparing to the yellow expanding circle).\n",

    "Now turn off the constant $T = 10^4$ K (comment out `rt_TConst=1d4` in the namelist), thus allowing the gas to cool or be heated by the photons. What changes in the evolution of the I-front, and why?

    "Change the photoionization cross section and photon energy. The current values are averages for a $T = 10^5$ K blackbody radiation. Increasing the energy and decreasing the cross sections corresponds to hotter stellar atmospheres, i.e. bigger stars. What does the cross section do to the I-front? What about the photon energy?\n",

    "Try out three photon groups. This allows you to approximate some spectral resolution compared to the single photon group (Grey approximation) we’ve been working with. For the photon group properties (in the RAMSES-RT namelist), try a $T = 10^5$ K blackbody\n",
