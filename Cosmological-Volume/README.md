# Cosmological Volume Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the generation of a large-scale
cosmological simulation.

## Before we start ... 
1. We will use [MUSIC](https://www-n.oca.eu/ohahn/MUSIC/) to generate initial conditions, and we must install it first. Follow the user guide [here](https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music/downloads/MUSIC_Users_Guide.pdf) to do so. Note that MUSIC requires FFTW and GSL libraries to be installed (as explained un MUSIC's user guide), which may require some anticipation.
2. We of course need [RAMSES](https://github.com/ramses-organisation/ramses) that may be installed by running `git clone https://github.com/ramses-organisation/ramses.git` in a terminal.



- generating initial conditions
- running RAMSES in different modes (N-body only, N-body + hydro)
- some level of analysis (identification of halos, ...)
